#Pet Care Giving App

I developed this Android application as a platform for connecting pet owners (customers) with pet caregivers. It allows customers to post caregiving requests for their pets, and caregivers can view these posts and confirm jobs. The app facilitates communication between both parties and provides features for managing profiles and feedback.
